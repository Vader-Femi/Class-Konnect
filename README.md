## EClass renamed to ClassKonnect
 
Kinda my final year project

Class Konnect is a native android app that enhances E-learning using video calls with open-source Jitsi Meet SDK, Firebase SDK, Dagger-Hilt for dependency Injection, and yes Jetpack Compose. A free alternative to schools with a maximum capacity of 75 participants per class.

Did I mention it was written in Compose? This is a my first time using Jetpack Compose.
