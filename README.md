# 🎓 EClass → ClassKonnect

**ClassKonnect** (formerly **EClass**) is an Android video-conferencing application designed to improve **e-learning** in educational institutions.

---

## 📖 A Short Story

ClassKonnect was born out of a real problem we faced during the **COVID-19 pandemic**.

We relied heavily on **Zoom’s free plan** for online classes, which meant getting disconnected every **40 minutes** and having to log back in repeatedly. It disrupted learning and broke focus.

I initially built the app using **Android Fragments**, but the buzz around the **stable release of Jetpack Compose**—especially during **DevFest 2022**—was too exciting to ignore. I decided to rewrite the entire app using **Compose**, and that decision completely changed my development journey.

Along the way, I:

* Learned modern UI patterns
* Became comfortable with declarative UI
* Got inspired to explore **Wear OS**, which had just gained Compose support

Just two months later—despite my **final year exams**—I released <a href="https://github.com/Vader-Femi/Devfesttttt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> <u>my first Wear OS application (Devfesttttt)</u> </a>.
But that’s a story for another day 😉

## 🎯 (Kind of) My Final Year Project

**ClassKonnect** is an Android **video-calling app** built with the **Jitsi Meet SDK** to support **synchronous learning**.

### Key Highlights

* Supports up to **75 participants** per class
* Built for **live video lectures**
* Free and open alternative for schools
* Designed with scalability and performance in mind

### Tech Used

* **Jitsi Meet SDK**
* **Firebase SDK**
* **Dagger-Hilt** (Dependency Injection)
* **Jetpack Compose** (Yes—Compose!)

> Did I mention it was written in Compose?
> This was my **first Compose project**, so you can imagine the excitement 😄
